# Geoinformation-Projects
People tell or want to do various amazing projects that are related with Geoinformatics. I tried to catch those brilliant ideas told by them and document here in this github repository.

1. Dr. Tri Dev Acharya has listed several projects on his #Mentor4Nepal (https://github.com/trydave/Mentor4Nepal) initiative githup page.
2. Chief Survey Officer (CSO) of Survey Department (SD) has following ideas regarding Geoinformatics of Sindhupalchok:
  * Preparing tourist map of Sunkoshi corridor begginning from TatoPani to Saptakoshi.
  * Preparing flood inundation map of Sunkoshi river. Flood Risk Zone of Sunkoshi in Sindhupalchok.
  * Rate of excavation of sand and aggregate in past, present, and future at Sunkoshi river.
  * Calculate/estimate the volume of construction materials obtained from any potential site along the bank of Sunkoshi river.
  * MoU between tourism business of Sunkoshi and Kathmandu University (KU) geomatics engineers so that both side be beneficial to each other.
  * Shuman Baral, could he select Sindhupalchok's major rivers as his MSc thesis site.
